# JavaStackingBlocks

A really simple mini-game, the result of me testing what can I do with JavaScript.

There are 3 stages; on each stage you have to pick the block and how many of it do you want (from 1 to 3).
At the end, the webpage displays all of the blocks you picked (from 3 to 9) in the correct order.
